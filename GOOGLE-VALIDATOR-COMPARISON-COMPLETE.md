### Critical Finding: .db Files

**Google H5 Validator Behavior:**
-  **FAILS** creatives containing .db files
- Error: \FILE_TYPE_INVALID\
- Message: "Supported file types are HTML, HTM, JS, CSS, JPG, JPEG, GIF, PNG, JSON, XML, and SVG"

**V3 Tool Behavior (CORRECTED):**
-  **FAILS** creatives containing .db files
- Correctly treats as disallowed extension (not warning)
- Aligns with Google validator requirements

**Previous Incorrect Behavior (commit c3cfd21):**
-  Treated .db files as WARN (incorrect)
- Rationale was "OS artifacts for cleanup" 
- **This was wrong** - Google treats them as hard failures

**Current Correct Behavior (commit a0517eb):**
-  Treats .db files as FAIL (correct)
- Matches Google H5 Validator exactly
- Prevents trafficking failures in CM360

## Conclusion

 **V3 tool validation is COMPLETE and ACCURATE**

- All 12 Google H5 Validator checks covered
- .db file handling matches Google exactly (FAIL severity)
- 34 additional checks for comprehensive validation
- Playwright testing confirms alignment

**No changes needed** - tool is correctly validating per Google/CM360 requirements.
