# Staging Environment Setup Complete

## Summary
Successfully created **app-V3-STAGING** as a pre-production testing environment.

## What Was Done
1.  Cloned entire app-V3 directory to app-V3-STAGING
2.  Updated package.json (name: ps-html5auditor-v3-staging, version: 3.0.0-staging)
3.  Updated index.html (title includes "- STAGING", orange favicon)
4.  Added orange STAGING badge to header
5.  Created README-STAGING.md with complete workflow documentation
6.  Verified build successful (20.74s)
7.  Committed to git (commit 09ad242)

## Visual Differentiation
- **Orange branding** (vs purple for production)
- **STAGING badge** in header (orange background, white text)
- **Orange favicon** (#f59e0b instead of purple #4f46e5)
- **Modified page title** includes "- STAGING"

## Usage Workflow
1. Develop/test new features in app-V3-STAGING
2. Build and test thoroughly (including Playwright MCP)
3. Once validated, carefully copy changes to app-V3
4. Never commit untested code to app-V3

## Development Commands
\\\powershell
cd app-V3-STAGING
npm install  # if needed
npm run dev  # start dev server
npm run build  # production build
\\\

## Next Steps
- Begin using staging for all new feature development
- Keep staging updated with critical fixes from production
- Test extensively before promoting to app-V3
- Consider adding staging-specific environment variables if needed
